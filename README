browsable listing of every file in xlocate

usage:
- run ./build.sh && ./voidfs

notes:
- needs about ~1.1g of ram on x86_64 when built with "GOARCH=386"
- send a SIGHUP to re-read the file list from disk

environment variables:
- VOIDFS_ADDR: address and port to listen on (default: "127.0.0.1:8080")
- VOIDFS_REPO: path to xlocate repository (default: "$HOME/.cache/xlocate.git")
